# Database Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
Your application is experiencing intermittent database connection failures to NeonDB. The error shows:
```
Can't reach database server at `ep-little-cloud-ad8zln2h-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech:5432`
```

## Quick Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Retry Logic
- Database operations now retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- Connection errors are handled gracefully with fallback data

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Better error messages and status codes
- Graceful degradation when database is unavailable

### 3. Connection Monitoring
- Added database health check script: `npm run db:check`

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Check NeonDB Status
1. Visit your NeonDB dashboard
2. Check if the database is in sleep mode (free tier limitation)
3. Verify the connection string is correct
4. Check if there are any resource limits being hit

### Option 2: Update Connection String
If using NeonDB free tier, you might need to use a different connection approach:

```env
# Instead of pooled connection
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@ep-little-cloud-ad8zln2h-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb"

# Try direct connection
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@ep-little-cloud-ad8zln2h.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb"
```

### Option 3: Switch to Alternative Database
For development, consider using:
1. **Local PostgreSQL** - Most reliable for development
2. **Supabase** - Good free tier with better reliability
3. **Railway** - Simple deployment with PostgreSQL

### Option 4: Upgrade NeonDB Plan
- Free tier has connection limits and auto-sleep
- Paid plans have better connection pooling and uptime

## Testing the Fixes

Run the database check:
```bash
npm run db:check
```

Test the application:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The dashboard should now show fallback data when the database is unavailable instead of crashing.

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Use connection pooling** - Already implemented with retry logic
2. **Add database health monitoring** - Consider a monitoring service
3. **Implement caching** - Redis or in-memory cache for frequently accessed data
4. **Database migration to more reliable provider** - For production use

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in your `.env.local`:
```env
DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection-string"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```
